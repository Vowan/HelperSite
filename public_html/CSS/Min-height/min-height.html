<p>
The min-height property is used to set the minimum height of a given element. It 
prevents the used value of the height property from becoming smaller than the value 
specified for min-height.
</p>
<p>
    The value of min-height overrides both max-height and height.

        </h4>
        The fixed minimum height. See &lt;length&gt; for possible units. Negative values 
            make the declaration invalid.

        </h4>
        The fixed minimum height expressed as a &lt;percentage&gt; of containing block's height. 
            Negative values make the declaration invalid.
    </li>
    <li><h4>max-content  <mark>experimental</mark></h4>
        The intrinsic preferred height.
    </li>
    <li><h4>min-content <mark>experimental</mark></h4>
        The intrinsic minimum height.
    </li>
    <li><h4>fill-available <mark>experimental</mark></h4>
        The containing block height minus horizontal margin, border and padding. Some browsers 
        implement an ancient name for this keyword, available.
    </li>
    <li><h4>fit-content <mark>experimental</mark></h4>
        According CSS3 Box, this is a synonym of min-content. CSS3 Sizing defines a more complex algorithm, but no browser implements it, even in an experimental way.
