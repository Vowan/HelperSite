<p>
The accesskey global attribute provides a hint for generating a keyboard shortcut 
for the current element. This attribute consists of a space-separated list of characters
(one single Unicode code point). The browser uses the first one that exists on the computer 
keyboard layout.

The operation to activate the accesskey depends on browser and its platform.
