<p>
The HTML &lt;time&gt; element represents either a time on a 24-hour clock or a precise 
    date in the Gregorian calendar (with optional time and timezone information).<br>

This element is intended to be used presenting dates and times in a machine readable 
format. This can be helpful for user agents to offer any event scheduling for user's calendar. 
</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>datetime</h4>This attribute indicates the time and date of the element 
        and must be a valid date with an optional time string. If the value cannot 
        be parsed as a date with an optional time string, the element does not have 
        an associated time stamp.
    </li>
    
</ul>
<h4>Usage note:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><h4></h4>This element is not appropriate for instances where a specific 
        date cannot be calculated, nor should it be used for dates prior to the 
        introduction to the Gregorian calendar (due to complications with calculating 
        those dates).
    </li>
    
</ul>
