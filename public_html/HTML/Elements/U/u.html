<p>
The HTML Underline Element (&lt;u&gt;) renders text with an underline, a line under the 
    baseline of its content.<br>

In HTML5, this element represents a span of text with an unarticulated, though 
explicitly rendered, non-textual annotation, such as labeling the text as being a 
proper name in Chinese text (a Chinese proper name mark), or labeling the text as
being misspelled.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<h4></h4>
<ul>
    <li><h4></h4>As with all purely styling elements, &lt;u&gt; has been deprecated in 
        HTML 4 and XHTML 1, but it has been re-introduced in HTML5 with other 
        semantics. If you want to underline text in a non-semantic manner, you 
        should use a &lt;span&gt; element, or another semantically appropriate element, 
            and style it with the CSS text-decoration property, with the underline value.
    </li>
    <li><h4></h4>The HTML 5 specification reminds developers that other elements are 
        almost always more appropriate than &lt;u&gt;.
    </li>
    
</ul>
