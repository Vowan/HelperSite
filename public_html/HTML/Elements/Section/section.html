<p>
The HTML &lt;section&gt; element represents a generic section of a document, i.e., a 
    thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. Each &lt;section&gt; should 
        be identified, typically by including a heading &lt;h1&gt;-&lt;h6&gt; element) as a 
     child of the &lt;section> element.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<h4>Usage note:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><h4></h4>If it makes sense to separately syndicate the content of a &lt;section&gt;
            element, use an &lt;article&gt; element instead.
    </li>
    <li><h4></h4>Do not use the &lt;section&gt; element as a generic container; this is what
            &lt;div&gt; is for, especially when the sectioning is only for styling purposes. 
            A rule of thumb is that a section should logically appear in the outline 
            of a document.
    </li>
    
</ul>
&lt;&gt;
