<p>
    The HTML Label Element (&lt;label&gt;) represents a caption for an item in a user interface. 
    It can be associated with a control either by placing the control element inside the 
    &lt;label&gt; element, or by using the for attribute. Such a control is called the labeled
    control of the label element. One input can be associated with multiple labels.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>accesskey </h4>
        A shortcut key to access this element from the keyboard.
    </li>
    <li><h4>for</h4>
        The ID of a labelable form-related element in the same document as the label element. 
        The first such element in the document with an ID matching the value of the for attribute
        is the labeled control for this label element.
        <strong>Note: </strong>A label element can have both a for attribute and a contained control 
        element, as long 
        as the for attribute points to the contained control element.
    </li>
    <li><h4>form <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        The form element that the label element is associated with (its form owner). 
        If specified, the value of the attribute must be the ID of a &lt;form&gt; element 
        in the same document. This attribute enables you to place label elements 
        anywhere within a document, not just as descendants of their form elements.


    </li>

</ul>
