<p>
The HTML &lt;ul&gt; element (or HTML Unordered List Element) represents 
    an unordered list of items, namely a collection of items that do not have a 
    numerical ordering, and their order in the list is meaningless. Typically, 
    unordered-list items are displayed with a bullet, which can be of several forms, 
    like a dot, a circle or a squared. The bullet style is not defined in the HTML 
    description of the page, but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type property.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>compact</h4>This Boolean attribute hints that the list should be rendered 
        in a compact style. The interpretation of this attribute depends on the user 
        agent and it doesn't work in all browsers. 
        <h5><mark>Usage note</mark></h5>Do not use this attribute, as it has been 
        deprecated: the &lt;ul&gt; element should be styled using CSS. To give a similar 
            effect as the compact attribute, the CSS property line-height can be used 
            with a value of 80%.
    </li>
    <li><h4>type<mark>deprecated</mark></h4>
        Used to set the bullet style for the list. The values defined under HTML3.2 
        and the transitional version of HTML 4.0/4.01 are:<br>

    circle,<br>
    disc,<br>
    and square.<br>

    </li>
    
</ul>
