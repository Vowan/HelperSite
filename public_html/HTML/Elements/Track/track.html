<p>
    The HTML &lt;track&gt; element is used as a child of the media elements—&lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt;. 
    It lets you specify timed text tracks (or time-based data), for example to automatically 
    handle subtitles. The tracks are formatted in WebVTT format (.vtt files) — Web Video 
    Text Tracks.
</p>
<p>
    The type of data that track adds to the media is set in the kind attribute, which 
    can take values of subtitles, captions, descriptions, chapters or metadata. The 
    element points to a source file containing timed text that the browser exposes when 
    the user requests additional data.
</p>
<p>
    A media element cannot have more than one track with the same kind, srclang, and label.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>default</h4>This attribute indicates that the track should be enabled unless the user's preferences indicate that another track is more appropriate. This may only be used on one track element per media element.
    </li>
    <li><h4>kind</h4>

        How the text track is meant to be used. If omitted the default kind is subtitles. The following keywords are allowed:
        <ul>
            <li>subtitles
                <ul>
                    <li>Subtitles provide translation of content that cannot be understood by the viewer. For example dialogue or text that is not English in an English language film.
                    <li>Subtitles may contain additional content, usually extra background information. For example the text at the beginning of the Star Wars films, or the date, time, and location of a scene.
                </ul>
            </li>
