<p>
The HTML element word break opportunity &lt;wbr&gt; represents a position within text 
where the browser may optionally break a line, though its line-breaking rules would 
not otherwise create a break at that location.
</p>
<p>
On UTF-8 encoded pages, &lt;wbr&gt; behaves like the U+200B ZERO-WIDTH SPACE code point. I
n particular, it behaves like a Unicode bidi BN code point, meaning it has no effect 
on bidi-ordering: &lt;div dir=rtl&gt;123&lt;wbr&gt;456&lt;/div&gt; displays, when not broken on two 
lines, 123,456 and not 456,123.
</p>
<p>
For the same reason, the &lt;wbr&gt; element does not introduce a hyphen at the line break 
point. To make a hyphen appear only at the end of a line, use the soft hyphen character 
entity (&ï»¿shy;) instead.

This element was first implemented in Internet Explorer 5.5 and was officially defined in HTML5.
