<p>
The box-decoration-break CSS property specifies how the background, padding, border, border-image, box-shadow, margin and clip of an element is applied when the box for the element is fragmented.  Fragmentation occurs when an inline box wraps onto multiple lines, or when a block spans more than one column inside a column layout container, or spans a page break when printed.  Each piece of the rendering for the element is called a fragment.

<ul>
    <li><h4>slice</h4>
        The element is rendered as if its box were not fragmented, and then the rendering for this hypothetical box is sliced into pieces for each line/column/page. Note that the hypothetical box can be different for each fragment since it uses its own height if the break occurs in the inline direction, and its own width if the break occurs in the block direction. See the CSS specification for details.
    </li>
    <li><h4>clone</h4>
        Each box fragment is rendered independently with the specified border, padding and margin wrapping each fragment. The border-radius, border-image and box-shadow, are applied to each fragment independently. The background is drawn independently in each fragment which means that a background image with background-repeat: no-repeat may be repeated multiple times.
