<p>
The HTML &lt;div&gt; element (or HTML Document Division Element) is the generic container 
    for flow content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be used 
    to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or 
    because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when 
    no other semantic element (such as &lt;article&gt; or &lt;nav&gt;) is appropriate.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.

The align attribute is obsolete; do not use it anymore.
