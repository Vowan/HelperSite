<p>
The HTML &lt;dialog&gt; element represents a dialog box or other interactive component,
    such as an inspector or window. &lt;form&gt; elements can be integrated within a dialog
        by specifying them with the attribute method="dialog". When such a form is 
        submitted, the dialog is closed with a returnValue attribute set to the value 
        of the submit button used.
</p>
<p>
    The ::backdrop CSS pseudo-element can be used to style behind a &lt;dialog&gt; element, 
    for example to dim inaccessible content whilst a modal dialog is active.
</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>open</h4>
        Indicates that the dialog is active and available for interaction. When the 
        open attribute is not set, it shouldn't be shown to the user.
    </li>
    
</ul>
