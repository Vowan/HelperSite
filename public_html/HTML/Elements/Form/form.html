<p>
    The HTML &lt;form&gt; element represents a document section that contains interactive 
    controls to submit information to a web server.<br>

    It is possible to use the :valid and :invalid CSS pseudo-classes to style a <form> element.
</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>accept <mark>HTML4</mark></h4>
        A comma-separated list of content types that the server accepts. 
        <strong>Usage note:</strong> This attribute has been removed in HTML5 and 
        should no longer be used. Instead, use the accept attribute of the specific &lt;input&gt; 
        element.
    </li>
    <li><h4>accept-charset</h4>A space- or comma-delimited list of character encodings 
        that the server accepts. The browser uses them in the order in which they are listed. 
        The default value, the reserved string "UNKNOWN", indicates the same encoding as that 
        of the document containing the form element.
        In previous versions of HTML, the different character encodings could be delimited by spaces or 
        commas. In HTML5, only spaces are allowed as delimiters.
    </li>
    <li><h4>action</h4>The URI of a program that processes the form information. This value 
        can be overridden by a formaction attribute on a &lt;button&gt; or &lt;input&gt; element.
    </li>
    <li><h4>autocapitalize <mark>not standardize</mark></h4>
        This is a nonstandard attribute used by iOS Safari Mobile which controls whether and 
        how the text value for textual form control descendants should be automatically 
        capitalized as it is entered/edited by the user. If the autocapitalize attribute 
        is specified on an individual form control descendant, it trumps the form-wide 
        autocapitalize setting. The non-deprecated values are available in iOS 5 and later. 
        The default value is sentences. Possible values are:
        <ul>
            <li>none: Completely disables automatic capitalization
            <li>sentences: Automatically capitalize the first letter of sentences.
            <li>words: Automatically capitalize the first letter of words.
            <li>characters: Automatically capitalize all characters.
            <li>on: Deprecated since iOS 5.
            <li>off: Deprecated since iOS 5.
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h4>autocomplete <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        Indicates whether input elements can by default have their values automatically completed 
        by the browser. This setting can be overridden by an autocomplete attribute on an element
        belonging to the form. Possible values are:
        <ul>
            <li>off: The user must explicitly enter a value into each field for every use, or the document 
                provides its own auto-completion method; the browser does not automatically complete entries.
            <li>on: The browser can automatically complete values based on values that the user has 
                previously entered in the form.
        </ul>
        For most modern browsers (including Firefox 38+, Google Chrome 34+, IE 11+) setting the autocomplete
        attribute will not prevent a browser's password manager from asking the user if they want to store 
        login (username and password) fields and, if they agree, from autofilling the login the next time 
        the user visits the page. See The autocomplete attribute and login fields.
        Note: If you set autocomplete to off in a form because the document provides its own 
        auto-completion, then you should also set autocomplete to off for each of the form's 
        input elements that the document can auto-complete. For details, see Google Chrome notes.

    </li>
    <li><h4>enctype </h4>
        When the value of the method attribute is post, enctype is the MIME type of content that
        is used to submit the form to the server. Possible values are:
        <ul>
            <li>application/x-www-form-urlencoded: The default value if the attribute is not specified.
            <li>multipart/form-data: The value used for an &lt;input&gt; element with the type attribute set to 
                "file".
            <li>text/plain (HTML5)
        </ul>
        This value can be overridden by a formenctype attribute on a &lt;button&gt; or &lt;input&gt; element.
    </li>
    <li><h4>method</h4>
        The HTTP method that the browser uses to submit the form. Possible values are:
        <ul>
            <li>post: Corresponds to the HTTP POST method ; form data are included in the body of the 
                form and sent to the server.
            <li>get: Corresponds to the HTTP GET method; form data are appended to the action attribute 
                URI with a '?' as separator, and the resulting URI is sent to the server. Use this method 
                when the form has no side-effects and contains only ASCII characters.
        </ul>
        This value can be overridden by a formmethod attribute on a &lt;button&gt; or &lt;input&gt; element.
    </li>
    <li><h4>name</h4>
        The name of the form. In HTML 4,its use is deprecated (id should be used instead). 
        It must be unique among the forms in a document and not just an empty string in HTML 5.
    </li>
    <li><h4>novalidate <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        This Boolean attribute indicates that the form is not to be validated when submitted. 
        If this attribute is not specified (and therefore the form is validated), this default 
        setting can be overridden by a formnovalidate attribute on a &lt;button&gt; or &lt;input&gt;
        element 
        belonging to the form.
    </li>
    <li><h4>target</h4>
        A name or keyword indicating where to display the response that is received after 
        submitting the form. In HTML 4, this is the name/keyword for a frame. In HTML5, it is 
        a name/keyword for a browsing context (for example, tab, window, or inline frame). 
        The following keywords have special meanings:
        <ul>
            <li>_self: Load the response into the same HTML 4 frame (or HTML5 browsing context) as
                the current one. This value is the default if the attribute is not specified.
            <li>_blank: Load the response into a new unnamed HTML 4 window or HTML5 browsing context.
            <li>_parent: Load the response into the HTML 4 frameset parent of the current frame, or HTML5 
                parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the 
                same way as _self.
            <li>_top: HTML 4: Load the response into the full original window, and cancel all other frames. 
                HTML5: Load the response into the top-level browsing context (i.e., the browsing context 
                that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this 
                option behaves the same way as _self.
            <li>iframename: The response is displayed in a named &lt;iframe&gt;
        </ul>
        HTML5: This value can be overridden by a formtarget attribute on a &lt;button&gt; or &lt;input&gt; element.
    </li>

</ul>
