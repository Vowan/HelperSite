<p>
The HTML Deleted Text Element (&lt;del&gt;) represents a range of text that has been deleted 
from a document. This element is often (but need not be) rendered with strike-through text.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>cite</h4>
        A URI for a resource that explains the change (for example, meeting minutes).
    </li>
    <li><h4>datetime</h4>
        This attribute indicates the time and date of the change and must be a valid 
        date with an optional time string. If the value cannot be parsed as a date with 
        an optional time string, the element does not have an associated time stamp.
    </li>
    
</ul>
