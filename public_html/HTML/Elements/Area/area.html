<p>
    The HTML &lt;area&gt; element defines a hot-spot region on an image, and optionally 
    associates it with a hypertext link. This element is used only within a &lt;map&gt; element.
</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>accesskey<mark>HTML 4 only</mark></h4>Specifies a keyboard navigation 
        accelerator for the element. Pressing ALT or a similar key in association 
        with the specified character selects the form control correlated with that 
        key sequence. Page designers are forewarned to avoid key sequences already 
        bound to browsers. This attribute is global since HTML5.
    </li>
    <li><h4>alt</h4>A text string alternative to display on browsers that do not 
        display images. The text should be phrased so that it presents the user 
        with the same kind of choice as the image would offer when displayed 
        without the alternative text. In HTML4, this attribute is required, but 
        may be the empty string (""). In HTML5, this attribute is required only 
        if the href attribute is used.
    </li>
    <li><h4>coords</h4>A set of values specifying the coordinates of the hot-spot 
        region. The number and meaning of the values depend upon the value specified 
        for the shape attribute. For a rect or rectangle shape, the coords value is 
        two x,y pairs: left, top, right, and bottom. For a circle shape, the value 
        is x,y,r where x,y is a pair specifying the center of the circle and r is a 
        value for the radius. For a poly or polygon< shape, the value is a set of x,y 
        pairs for each point in the polygon: x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3, and so on. In HTML4, 
        the values are numbers of pixels or percentages, if a percent sign (%) is appended; 
        in HTML5, the values are numbers of CSS pixels.
    </li>
    <li><h4>download<mark>HTML5</mark> </h4>This attribute, if present, indicates that 
        the author intends the hyperlink to be used for downloading a resource. See &lt;a&gt;
            for a full description of the download attribute.
    </li>
    <li><h4>href</h4>The hyperlink target for the area. Its value is a valid URL. 
        In HTML4, either this attribute or the nohref attribute must be present in 
        the element. In HTML5, this attribute may be omitted; if so, the area element 
        does not represent a hyperlink.
    </li>
    <li><h4>hreflang<mark>HTML5</mark></h4>Indicates the language of the linked resource. 
        Allowed values are determined by BCP47. Use this attribute only if the href 
        attribute is present.
    </li>
    <li><h4>name<mark>HTML 4 only</mark> </h4>Define a names for the clickable area so that it can be scripted 
        by older browsers.
    </li>
    <li><h4>media<mark>HTML5</mark></h4>A hint of the media for which the linked resource was designed, 
        for example print and screen. If omitted, it defaults to all. Use this attribute 
        only if the href attribute is present.
    </li>
    <li><h4>nohref<mark>HTML 4 only</mark></h4>Indicates that no hyperlink exists for the associated area. 
        Either this attribute or the href attribute must be present in the element. 
    </li>
    <li><h4>referrerpolicy<mark>experimental</mark></h4>
        A string indicating which referrer to use when fetching the resource:
        <ul>
            <li>"no-referrer" meaning that the Referer: header will not be sent.
            <li>"no-referrer-when-downgrade" meaning that no Referer: header will be sent when navigating to an origin without TLS (HTTPS). This is a user agentâ€™s default behavior, if no policy is otherwise specified.
            <li>"origin" meaning that the referrer will be the origin of the page, that is roughly the scheme, the host and the port.
            <li>"origin-when-cross-origin" meaning that navigations to other origins will be limited to the scheme, the host and the port, while navigations on the same origin will include the referrer's path. 
            <li>"unsafe-url" meaning that the referrer will include the origin and the path (but not the fragment, password, or username). This case is unsafe because it can leak origins and paths from TLS-protected resources to insecure origins.
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h4>rel<mark>HTML5</mark></h4>For anchors containing the href attribute, this attribute specifies 
        the relationship of the target object to the link object. The value is a comma-separated 
        list of link types values. The values and their semantics will be registered by some 
        authority that might have meaning to the document author. The default relationship, 
        if no other is given, is void. Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.
    </li>
    <li><h4>shape</h4>The shape of the associated hot spot. The specifications for HTML 5 and 
        HTML 4 define the values rect, which defines a rectangular region; circle, which defines 
        a circular region; poly, which defines a polygon; and default, which indicates the entire 
        region beyond any defined shapes. Many browsers, notably Internet Explorer 4 and higher, 
        support circ, polygon, and rectangle as valid values for shape; these values are
    </li>
    <li><h4>tabindex<mark>HTML 4 only</mark></h4>A numeric value specifying the position of 
        the defined area in the browser tabbing order. This attribute is global in HTML5.
    </li>
    <li><h4>target</h4>
        This attribute specifies where to display the linked resource. In HTML4, this is the name of, or a keyword for, a frame. In HTML5, it is a name of, or keyword for, a browsing context (for example, tab, window, or inline frame). The following keywords have special meanings:
        <ul>
            <li> _self: Load the response into the same HTML4 frame (or HTML5 browsing context) as the current one. This value is the default if the attribute is not specified.
            <li> _blank: Load the response into a new unnamed HTML4 window or HTML5 browsing context.
            <li>_parent: Load the response into the HTML4 frameset parent of the current frame or HTML5 parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.
            <li>_top: In HTML4: Load the response into the full, original window, canceling all other frames. In HTML5: Load the response into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.
        </ul>
        Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.
    </li>
    <li><h4>type</h4>This attribute specifies the media type in the form of a MIME type for the link target. Generally, this is provided strictly as advisory information; however, in the future a browser might add a small icon for multimedia types. For example, a browser might add a small speaker icon when type is set to audio/wav. For a complete list of recognized MIME types, see http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/references.html#ref-MIMETYPES. Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.
    </li>
    
</ul>
