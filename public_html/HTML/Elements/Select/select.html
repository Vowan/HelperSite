<p>
The HTML select (&lt;select&gt;) element represents a control that presents a menu of
 options. The options within the menu are represented by &lt;option&gt; elements,
 which can be grouped by &lt;optgroup&gt; elements. Options can be pre-selected for the user.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>autofocus  <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        This attribute lets you specify that a form control should have input focus 
        when the page loads, unless the user overrides it, for example by typing 
        in a different control. Only one form element in a document can have the 
        autofocus attribute, which is a Boolean.
    </li>
    <li><h4>disabled</h4>This Boolean attribute indicates that the user cannot interact 
        with the control. If this attribute is not specified, the control inherits 
        its setting from the containing element, for example fieldset; if there is 
        no containing element with the disabled attribute set, then the control is enabled.
    </li>
    <li><h4>form <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        The form element that the select element is associated with (its "form owner"). 
        If this attribute is specified, its value must be the ID of a form element in 
        the same document. This enables you to place select elements anywhere within a 
        document, not just as descendants of their form elements.
    </li>
    <li><h4>multiple</h4>
        This Boolean attribute indicates that multiple options can be selected in the list. 
        If it is not specified, then only one option can be selected at a time.
    </li>
    <li><h4>name</h4>
        The name of the control.
    </li>
    <li><h4>required <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        A Boolean attribute indicating that an option with a non-empty string value must be selected.
    </li>
    <li><h4>size</h4>
        If the control is presented as a scrolled list box, this attribute represents
        the number of rows in the list that should be visible at one time. Browsers are 
        not required to present a select element as a scrolled list box. The default value is 0.
    </li>
    
</ul>
