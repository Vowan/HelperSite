<p>
The &lt;percentage&gt; CSS data types represent a percentage value. Many CSS properties can 
    take percentage values, often to define sizes in terms of parent objects. Percentages 
    are formed by a &lt;number&gt; immediately followed by the percentage sign %. Just as is 
        the case with all other units in CSS, there isn't a space between the '%' and the number.

<p>
    Note: only calculated values are inherited. So, even if a percentage value is used on 
    the parent property, a real value, like a width in pixel for a <length> value, will be 
    accessible on the inherited property, not the percentage value.
