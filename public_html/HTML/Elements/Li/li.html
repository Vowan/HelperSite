<p>
    The HTML &lt;li&gt; element (or HTML List Item Element) is used to represent an item in 
    a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list (&lt;ol&gt;), 
    an unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;), or a menu (&lt;menu&gt;). In menus and unordered lists, 
    list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they 
    are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>value</h4>This integer attribute indicates the current ordinal value 
        of the list item as defined by the &lt;ol&gt; element. The only allowed value 
        for this attribute is a number, even if the list is displayed with Roman 
        numerals or letters. List items that follow this one continue numbering 
        from the value set. The value attribute has no meaning for unordered lists 
        (&lt;ul&gt;) or for menus (&lt;menu&gt;). <br>
        Note: This attribute was deprecated in HTML4, but reintroduced in HTML5.<br>
        Note: Prior to Gecko 9.0, negative values were incorrectly converted to 0. 
        Starting in Gecko 9.0 all integer values are correctly parsed.
    </li>
    <li><h4>type(deprecated)</h4>This character attribute indicates the numbering type:

        a: lowercase letters<br>
        A: uppercase letters<br>
        i: lowercase Roman numerals<br>
        I: uppercase Roman numerals<br>
        1: numbers<br>
        Usage note: This attribute has been deprecated: use the CSS list-style-type property instead.

    </li>

</ul>
