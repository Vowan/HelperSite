<p>
    The border-image CSS property allows drawing an image on the borders of elements. This makes drawing complex looking widgets much simpler than it has been and removes the need for nine boxes in some cases. The border-image is used instead of the border styles given by the border-style properties.
</p><p>
    It is important to note that if the computed value of border-image-source, which can be set either by border-image-source or the shorthand border-image, is none, or if the image cannot be displayed, the border styles will be used.
