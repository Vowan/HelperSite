<p>
The HTML &lt;b&gt; Element represents a span of text stylistically different from normal 
    text, without conveying any special importance or relevance. It is typically used 
    for keywords in a summary, product names in a review, or other spans of text whose 
    typical presentation would be boldfaced. Another example of its use is to mark the 
    lead sentence of each paragraph of an article

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<h4>Usage notes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><h4></h4>Do not confuse the &lt;b&gt; element with the &lt;strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, or &lt;mark&gt; 
         elements. The &lt;strong&gt; element represents text of certain importance, &lt;em&gt;
         puts some emphasis on the text and the &lt;mark&gt; element represents text of 
         certain relevance. The &lt;b&gt; element doesn't convey such special semantic 
             information; use it only when no others fit.
    </li>
    <li><h4></h4>
        Similarly, do not mark titles and headings using the &lt;b&gt; element. For this 
       purpose, use the &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; tags. Further, stylesheets can change the 
       default style of these elements, with the result that they are not necessarily 
       displayed in bold.
    </li>
    <li><h4></h4>
        It is a good practice to use the class attribute on the &lt;b&gt; in order to convey 
        additional semantic information (for example &lt;b class="lead"&gt; for the first 
        sentence in a paragraph). This eases the development of several stylings of 
        a web document, without the need to change its HTML code.
    </li>
    <li><h4></h4>
        Historically, the &lt;b&gt; element was meant to make text boldface. Styling 
        information has been deprecated since HTML4, so the meaning of the &lt;b&gt; 
        element has been changed.
    </li>
    <li><h4></h4>
        If there is no semantic purpose on using the &lt;b&gt; element, using css property 
            font-weight with bold value would be a better choice for making text bold.
    </li>
</ul>
