<p>
The align-self CSS property aligns flex items of the current flex line overriding the align-items value. If any of the flex item's cross-axis margin is set to auto, then align-self is ignored.

<ul>
    <li><h4>auto</h4>
    Computes to parent's align-items value or stretch if the element has no parent.
    </li>
    <li><h4>flex-start</h4>
    The cross-start margin edge of the flex item is flushed with the cross-start edge of the line.
    </li>
    <li><h4>flex-end</h4>
    The cross-end margin edge of the flex item is flushed with the cross-end edge of the line.
    </li>
    <li><h4>center</h4>
The flex item's margin box is centered within the line on the cross-axis. If the cross-size of the item is larger than the flex container, it will overflow equally in both directions.
    </li>
    <li><h4>baseline</h4>
All flex items are aligned such that their baselines align. The item with the largest distance between its cross-start margin edge and its baseline is flushed with the cross-start edge of the line.
    </li>
    <li><h4>stretch</h4>
    Flex items are stretched such as the cross-size of the item's margin box is the same as the line while respecting width and height constraints.
    </li>
    
</ul>
