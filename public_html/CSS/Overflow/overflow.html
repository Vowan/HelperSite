<p>
The overflow property specifies whether to clip content, render scrollbars or just display content when it overflows its block level container.
</p>
<p>
Using the overflow property with a value different to visible (its default) will create a new block formatting context. This is technically necessary â€” if a float intersected with the scrolling element it would forcibly rewrap the content. The rewrap would happen after each scroll step, leading to a slow scrolling experience.
</p>
<p>
In order for the overflow property to have an effect, the block level container must either have a bounding height (height or max-height) or have white-space set to nowrap.

<ul>
    <li><h4>visible</h4>
            Default value. Content is not clipped, it may be rendered outside the content box.
    </li>
    <li><h4>hidden</h4>
            The content is clipped and no scrollbars are provided.
    </li>
    <li><h4>scroll</h4>
            The content is clipped and desktop browsers use scrollbars, whether or not any content is clipped. This avoids any problem with scrollbars appearing and disappearing in a dynamic environment. Printers may print overflowing content.
    </li>
    <li><h4>auto</h4>
            Depends on the user agent. Desktop browsers like Firefox provide scrollbars if content overflows.
    </li>
    
</ul>
