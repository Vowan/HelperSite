<p>
    The HTML &lt;source&gt; element is used to specify multiple media resources for 
    &lt;picture&gt;, &lt;audio&gt;and &lt;video&gt; elements. It is an empty element. It is commonly 
    used to serve the same media in multiple formats supported by different browsers.
</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>sizes <mark>experimental</mark></h4>
        Is a list of source sizes that describes the final rendered width of the 
        image represented by the source. Each source size consists of a comma-separated 
        list of media condition-length pairs. This information is used by the browser to 
        determine, before laying the page out, which image defined in srcset to use.
        The sizes attribute has an effect only when the &lt;source> element is the direct child of 
        a &lt;picture&gt; element.
    </li>
    <li><h4>src</h4>
        Required for &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt;, address of the media resource. The value of 
        this attribute is ignored when the &lt;source&gt; element is placed inside a &lt;picture&gt; element.
    </li>
    <li><h4>srcset</h4>
        A list of one or more strings separated by commas indicating a set of possible images 
        represented by the source for the browser to use. Each string is composed of:
        <ol>
            <li>one URL to an image,
            <li>a width descriptor, that is a positive integer directly followed by 'w'. The default 
                value, if missing, is the infinity.
            <li>a pixel density descriptor, that is a positive floating number directly followed by 
                'x'. The default value, if missing, is 1x.
        </ol>
        Each string in the list must have at least a width descriptor or a pixel density descriptor 
        to be valid. Among the list, there must be only one string containing the same tuple of width 
        descriptor and pixel density descriptor.
        The browser chooses the most adequate image to display at a given point of time.
        The srcset attribute has an effect only when the &lt;source&gt; element is the direct child of a 
        &lt;picture&gt; element.
    </li>
    <li><h4>type</h4>

        The MIME-type of the resource, optionally with a codecs parameter. See RFC 4281 
        for information about how to specify codecs.
    </li>
    <li><h4>media</h4>
        Media query of the resource's intended media; this should be used only in a 
        &lt;picture&gt; element.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    If the type attribute isn't specified, the media's type is retrieved from the server and checked to see if Gecko can handle it; if it can't be rendered, the next source is checked. If the type attribute is specified, it's compared against the types Gecko can play, and if it's not recognized, the server doesn't even get queried; instead, the next source element is checked at once.
