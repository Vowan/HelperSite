<p>
The flex-direction CSS property specifies how flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis and the direction (normal or reversed).
</p>
<p>
Note that the value row and row-reverse are affected by the directionality of the flex container. If its dir attribute is ltr, row represents the horizontal axis oriented from the left to the right, and row-reverse from the right to the left; if the dir attribute is rtl, row represents the axis oriented from the right to the left, and row-reverse from the left to the right.
