<p>
    The Table cell HTML element (&lt;td&gt;) defines a cell of a table that contains data. 
    It participates in the table model.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>colspan</h4>
        This attribute contains a non-negative integer value that indicates for how 
        many columns the cell extends. Its default value is 1; if its value is set 
        to 0, it extends until the end of the &lt;colgroup&gt;, even if implicitly defined, 
        that the cell belongs to. Values higher than 1000 will be considered as incorrect 
        and will be set to the default value (1).
        <strong>Note: </strong>In HTML5 this attribute only accepts values greater than zero since it must 
        not be used to overlap cells. Besides, Firefox is the only browser to support the 
        0 value as defined in the HTML 4.01 specification.
    </li>
    <li><h4>rowspan</h4>This attribute contains a non-negative integer value that 
        indicates for how many rows the cell extends. Its default value is 1; if its 
        value is set to 0, it extends until the end of the table section (&lt;thead&gt;, &lt;tbody&gt;, 
    <tfoot>, even if implicitly defined, that the cell belongs to. Values higher than 65534
        are clipped down to 65534.
        </li>

</ul>
