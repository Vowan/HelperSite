<p>
    The HTML element &lt;input&gt; is used to create interactive controls for web-based forms 
    in order to accept data from the user. How an &lt;input&gt; works varies considerably 
    depending on the value of its type attribute
</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>type</h4>
        The type of control to display. The default type is text, if this attribute is
        not specified. Possible values are:
        <ul>
            <li>button: A push button with no default behavior.
            <li> checkbox: A check box. You must use the value attribute to define the value 
                submitted by this item. Use the checked attribute to indicate whether this item 
                is selected. You can also use the indeterminate attribute to indicate that the 
                checkbox is in an indeterminate state (on most platforms, this draws a horizontal 
                line across the checkbox).
            <li>color: HTML5 A control for specifying a color. A color picker's UI has no required
                features other than accepting simple colors as text (more info).
            <li>date: HTML5 A control for entering a date (year, month, and day, with no time).
            <li>datetime: HTML5 A control for entering a date and time (hour, minute, second, 
                and fraction of a second) based on UTC time zone.
            <li>datetime-local: HTML5 A control for entering a date and time, with no time zone.
            <li>email: HTML5 A field for editing an e-mail address. The input value is validated 
                to contain either the empty string or a single valid e-mail address before submitting. 
                The :valid and :invalid CSS pseudo-classes are applied as appropriate.
            <li>file: A control that lets the user select a file. Use the accept attribute to define
                the types of files that the control can select.
            <li>hidden: A control that is not displayed, but whose value is submitted to the server.
            <li>image: A graphical submit button. You must use the src attribute to define the source 
                of the image and the alt attribute to define alternative text. You can use the height 
                and width attributes to define the size of the image in pixels.
            <li> month: HTML5 A control for entering a month and year, with no time zone.
            <li>number: HTML5 A control for entering a floating point number.
            <li>password: A single-line text field whose value is obscured. Use the maxlength 
                attribute to specify the maximum length of the value that can be entered.
            <li>radio: A radio button. You must use the value attribute to define the value 
                submitted by this item. Use the checked attribute to indicate whether this 
                item is selected by default. Radio buttons that have the same value for the 
                name attribute are in the same "radio button group"; only one radio button 
                in a group can be selected at a time.
            <li>range: HTML5 A control for entering a number whose exact value is not important. 
                This type control uses the following default values if the corresponding attributes 
                are not specified:
                <ul>
                    <li> min: 0
                    <li>max: 100
                    <li>value: min + (max-min)/2, or min if max is less than min
                    <li>step: 1
                </ul>
            <li>reset: A button that resets the contents of the form to default values.
            <li>search: HTML5 A single-line text field for entering search strings; line-breaks are
                automatically removed from the input value.
            <li>submit: A button that submits the form.
            <li>tel: HTML5 A control for entering a telephone number; line-breaks are automatically 
                removed from the input value, but no other syntax is enforced. You can use attributes 
                such as pattern and maxlength to restrict values entered in the control. The :valid and
                :invalid CSS pseudo-classes are applied as appropriate.
            <li>text: A single-line text field; line-breaks are automatically removed from the input value.
            <li> time: HTML5 A control for entering a time value with no time zone.
            <li>url: HTML5 A field for editing a URL. The input value is validated to contain either 
                the empty string or a valid absolute URL before submitting. Line-breaks and leading or 
                trailing whitespace are automatically removed from the input value. You can use attributes 
                such as pattern and maxlength to restrict values entered in the control. The :valid and 
                :invalid CSS pseudo-classes are applied as appropriate.
            <li>week: HTML5 A control for entering a date consisting of a week-year number and a week 
                number with no time zone.
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h4>accept</h4>
        If the value of the type attribute is file, this attribute indicates the types of 
        files that the server accepts; otherwise it is ignored. The value must be a 
        comma-separated list of unique content type specifiers:
        <ul>
            <li>A file extension starting with the STOP character (U+002E). (E.g.: ".jpg,.png,.doc")
            <li>A valid MIME type with no extensions
            <li>audio/* representing sound files HTML5
            <li>video/* representing video files HTML5
            <li>image/* representing image files HTML5
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h4>accesskey  <mark>HTML 4 only, Obsolete since HTML5</mark></h4>
        A single-character that the user can press to switch input focus to the control.
        This attribute is global in HTML5.
    </li>
    <li><h4>mozactionhint <mark>not standardized</mark></h4>
        Specifies an "action hint" used to determine how to label the enter key on mobile 
        devices with virtual keyboards. Supported values are go, done, next, search, and 
        send; these automatically get mapped to the appropriate string (and are case-insensitive).
    </li>
    <li><h4>autocapitalize <mark>not standardized</mark></h4>
        This is a nonstandard attribute used by iOS Safari Mobile which controls whether and 
        how the text value should be automatically capitalized as it is entered/edited by the 
        user. The non-deprecated values are available in iOS 5 and later. Possible values are:
        <ul>
            <li>none: Completely disables automatic capitalization
            <li>sentences: Automatically capitalize the first letter of sentences.
            <li>words: Automatically capitalize the first letter of words.
            <li>characters: Automatically capitalize all characters.
            <li>on: Deprecated since iOS 5.
            <li>off: Deprecated since iOS 5.
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h4>autocomplete <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        This attribute indicates whether the value of the control can be automatically 
        completed by the browser.
        Possible values are: 
        <ul>
            <li>off: The user must explicitly enter a value into this field for every use, or the 
                document provides its own auto-completion method; the browser does not automatically
                complete the entry.
            <li>on: The browser is allowed to automatically complete the value based on values that 
                the user has entered during previous uses, however on does not provide any further 
                information about what kind of data the user might be expected to enter. 
            <li>name: Full name
            <li>honorific-prefix: Prefix or title (e.g. "Mr.", "Ms.", "Dr.", "Mlle")
            <li>given-name (first name)
            <li>additional-name

            <li>current-password
            <li>organization-title: Job title (e.g. "Software Engineer", "Senior Vice President", 
                "Deputy Managing Director")
            <li>organization
            <li>street-address
            <li>address-line1, address-line2, address-line3, address-level4, address-level3,
                address-level2, address-level1
            <li>country
            <li>country-name
            <li> postal-code
            <li>cc-name: Full name as given on the payment instrument
            <li>cc-given-name
            <li>cc-additional-name
            <li>cc-family-name

            <li>transaction-currency
            <li>transaction-amount
            <li>language: Preferred language; Valid BCP 47 language tag
            <li>bday
            <li>bday-day
            <li>bday-month

        <p>
            See the WHATWG Standard for more detailed information.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the autocomplete attribute is not specified on an input element, then the browser uses 
            the autocomplete attribute value of the &lt;input&gt; element's form owner. The form owner is 
            either the form element that this &lt;input&gt; element is a descendant of, or the form element 
            whose id is specified by the form attribute of the input element. For more information, 
            see the autocomplete attribute in &lt;form&gt;.
        </p>
        <p>
            The autocomplete attribute also controls whether Firefox will, unlike other browsers, 
            persist the dynamic disabled state and (if applicable) dynamic checkedness of an &lt;input&gt;
            across page loads. The persistence feature is enabled by default. Setting the value of 
            the autocomplete attribute to off disables this feature; this works even when the 
            autocomplete attribute would normally not apply to the &lt;input&gt; by virtue of its type. 
            See bug 654072.
        </p>
        <p>
            For most modern browsers (including Firefox 38+, Google Chrome 34+, IE 11+) setting 
            the autocomplete attribute will not prevent a browser's password manager from asking 
            the user if they want to store login (username and password) fields and, if they agree, 
            from autofilling the login the next time the user visits the page. See The autocomplete 
            attribute and login fields.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>autocorrect  <mark>not standardized</mark></h4>
        This is a nonstandard attribute supported by Safari that is used to control whether 
        autocorrection should be enabled when the user is entering/editing the text value of 
        the &lt;input&gt;. Possible attribute values are:

        on: Enable autocorrection
        off: Disable autocorrection

    </li>
    <li><h4>autofocus <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        This Boolean attribute lets you specify that a form control should 
        have input focus when the page loads, unless the user overrides it, 
        for example by typing in a different control. Only one form element in 
        a document can have the autofocus attribute, which is a Boolean. It cannot 
        be applied if the type attribute is set to hidden (that is, you cannot 
        automatically set focus to a hidden control). Note that the focusing of 
        the control may occur before the firing of the DOMContentLoaded event.
    </li>
    <li><h4>autosave  <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        This attribute should be defined as a unique value. If the value of the type
        attribute is search, previous search term values will persist in the dropdown 
        across page load.
    </li>
    <li><h4>checked</h4>


        When the value of the type attribute is radio or checkbox, the presence of this 
        Boolean attribute indicates that the control is selected by default; otherwise it is ignored.<br>

        Firefox will, unlike other browsers, by default, persist the dynamic checked state of 
        an <input> across page loads. Use the autocomplete attribute to control this feature.

    </li>
    <li><h4>disabled</h4>
        This Boolean attribute indicates that the form control is not available for interaction. 
        In particular, the click event will not be dispatched on disabled controls. Also, a 
        disabled control's value isn't submitted with the form.<br>

        Firefox will, unlike other browsers, by default, persist the dynamic disabled state of an 
        <input> across page loads. Use the autocomplete attribute to control this feature
    </li>
    <li><h4>form  <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        The form element that the input element is associated with (its form owner). 
        The value of the attribute must be an id of a &lt;form&gt; element in the same document. 
        If this attribute is not specified, this &lt;input&gt; element must be a descendant
        of a &lt;form&gt; element. This attribute enables you to place &lt;input&gt; elements 
        anywhere within a document, not just as descendants of their form elements. An 
        input can only be associated with one form.
    </li>
    <li><h4>formaction <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        The URI of a program that processes the information submitted by the input element, 
        if it is a submit button or image. If specified, it overrides the action attribute 
        of the element's form owner.
    </li>
    <li><h4>formenctype  <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        If the input element is a submit button or image, this attribute specifies the type of 
        content that is used to submit the form to the server. Possible values are:
        <ul>
            <li>application/x-www-form-urlencoded: The default value if the attribute is not specified.
            <li>multipart/form-data: Use this value if you are using an &lt;input&gt; element with the type 
                attribute set to file.
            <li>text/plain
        </ul>
        If this attribute is specified, it overrides the enctype attribute of the element's form owner.
    </li>
    <li><h4>formmethod <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        If the input element is a submit button or image, this attribute specifies the HTTP 
        method that the browser uses to submit the form. Possible values are:
        <ul>
            <li>post: The data from the form is included in the body of the form and is sent to the
                server.
            <li>get: The data from the form are appended to the form attribute URI, with a '?' as a 
                separator, and the resulting URI is sent to the server. Use this method when the form 
                has no side-effects and contains only ASCII characters.
        </ul>
        If specified, this attribute overrides the method attribute of the element's form owner.
    </li>
    <li><h4>formnovalidate <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        If the input element is a submit button or image, this Boolean attribute specifies 
        that the form is not to be validated when it is submitted. If this attribute is 
        specified, it overrides the novalidate attribute of the element's form owner.
    </li>
    <li><h4>formtarget <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        If the input element is a submit button or image, this attribute is a name or 
        keyword indicating where to display the response that is received after submitting 
        the form. This is a name of, or keyword for, a browsing context (for example, tab, 
        window, or inline frame). If this attribute is specified, it overrides the target 
        attribute of the elements's form owner. The following keywords have special meanings:
        <ul>
            <li> _self: Load the response into the same browsing context as the current one. This value
                is the default if the attribute is not specified.
            <li> _blank: Load the response into a new unnamed browsing context.
            <li> _parent: Load the response into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there
                is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.
            <li>_top: Load the response into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context
                that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this 
                option behaves the same way as _self.
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h4>height <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        If the value of the type attribute is image, this attribute defines the height of 
        the image displayed for the button.
    </li>
    <li><h4>incremental <mark>nonstandard</mark></h4>
        This is a nonstandard attribute supported by Safari that only applies when the 
        type is search. If the attribute is present, regardless of what its value is, 
        the &lt;input&gt; fires search events as the user edits the text value. The event 
        is only fired after an implementation-defined timeout has elapsed since the 
        most recent keystroke; new keystrokes reset the timeout. In other words, the 
        event firing is debounced. If the attribute is absent, the search event is 
        only fired when the user explicitly initiates a search (e.g. by pressing the 
        Enter key while within field). incremental
    </li>
    <li><h4>inputmode <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        A hint to the browser for which keyboard to display. This attribute applies when
        the value of the type attribute is text, password, email, or url. Possible values are:
        <ul>   
            <li>verbatim: Alphanumeric, non-prose content such as usernames and passwords.
            <li>latin: Latin-script input in the user's preferred language with typing aids such 
                as text prediction enabled. For human-to-computer communication such as search boxes.
            <li>latin-name: As latin, but for human names.
            <li>latin-prose: As latin, but with more aggressive typing aids. For human-to-human 
                communication such as instant messaging or email.
            <li>full-width-latin: As latin-prose, but for the user's secondary languages.
            <li>kana: Kana or romaji input, typically hiragana input, using full-width characters, 
                with support for converting to kanji. Intended for Japanese text input.
            <li> katakana: Katakana input, using full-width characters, with support for converting 
                to kanji. Intended for Japanese text input.
            <li>numeric: Numeric input, including keys for the digits 0 to 9, the user's preferred 
                thousands separator character, and the character for indicating negative numbers. 
                Intended for numeric codes, e.g. credit card numbers. For actual numbers, prefer
                using &lt;input type="number"&gt;
            <li>tel: Telephone input, including asterisk and pound key. Use &lt;input type="tel"&gt; if 
                possible instead.
            <li>email: Email input. Use &lt;input type="email"&gt; if possible instead.
            <li>url: URL input. Use &lt;input type="url"&gt; if possible instead.
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h4>list <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        Identifies a list of pre-defined options to suggest to the user. The value must be 
        the id of a &lt;datalist&gt; element in the same document. The browser displays only options 
        that are valid values for this input element. This attribute is ignored when the 
        type attribute's value is hidden, checkbox, radio, file, or a button type.
    </li>
    <li><h4>max <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        The maximum (numeric or date-time) value for this item, which must not be less than 
        its minimum (min attribute) value.
    </li>
    <li><h4>maxlength</h4>
        If the value of the type attribute is text, email, search, password, tel, or url, 
        this attribute specifies the maximum number of characters (in Unicode code points) 
        that the user can enter; for other control types, it is ignored. It can exceed the 
        value of the size attribute. If it is not specified, the user can enter an unlimited 
        number of characters. Specifying a negative number results in the default behavior; 
        that is, the user can enter an unlimited number of characters. The constraint is 
        evaluated only when the value of the attribute has been changed.
    </li>
    <li><h4>min  <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        The minimum (numeric or date-time) value for this item, which must not be greater 
        than its maximum (max attribute) value.
    </li>
    <li><h4>minlength  <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        If the value of the type attribute is text, email, search, password, tel, or url,
        this attribute specifies the minimum number of characters (in Unicode code points) 
        that the user can enter; for other control types, it is ignored.
    </li>
    <li><h4>multiple <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        This Boolean attribute indicates whether the user can enter more than one value. 
        This attribute applies when the type attribute is set to email or file; otherwise 
        it is ignored.
    </li>
    <li><h4>name</h4>
        The name of the control, which is submitted with the form data.
    </li>
    <li><h4>pattern  <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        A regular expression that the control's value is checked against. The pattern 
        must match the entire value, not just some subset. Use the title attribute to 
        describe the pattern to help the user. This attribute applies when the value of 
        the type attribute is text, search, tel, url or email; otherwise it is ignored. 
        The regular expression language is the same as JavaScript's. The pattern is not 
        surrounded by forward slashes.
    </li>
    <li><h4>placeholder <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        A hint to the user of what can be entered in the control . The placeholder 
        text must not contain carriage returns or line-feeds. This attribute applies when the value of the type attribute is text, search, tel, url or email; otherwise it is ignored.
        <strong>Note:</strong> Do not use the placeholder attribute instead of a 
        &lt;label&gt; element. Their purposes are different: the &lt;label&gt; attribute describes 
        the role of the form element; that is, it indicates what kind of information is 
        expected, the placeholder attribute is a hint about the format the content should 
        take. There are cases in which the placeholder attribute is never displayed to the
        user, so the form must be understandable without it.   
    </li>
    <li><h4>readonly <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        This Boolean attribute indicates that the user cannot modify the value of the control.
        It is ignored if the value of the type attribute is hidden, range, color, checkbox, 
        radio, file, or a button type (such as button or submit).
    </li>
    <li><h4>required <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        This attribute specifies that the user must fill in a value before submitting a form. 
        It cannot be used when the type attribute is hidden, image, or a button type (submit, 
        reset, or button). The :optional and :required CSS pseudo-classes will be applied to 
        the field as appropriate.
    </li>
    <li><h4>results <mark>nonstandard</mark></h4>
        This is a nonstandard attribute supported by Safari that only applies when the type 
        is search. It is used to control the maximum number of entries that should be displayed 
        in the &lt;input&gt;'s native dropdown list of past search queries. Its value should be a 
        nonnegative decimal integer.
    </li>
    <li><h4>selectionDirection <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>The direction in which selection occurred. 
        This is "forward" if the selection was made from left-to-right in an LTR locale or 
        right-to-left in an RTL locale, or "backward" if the selection was made in the opposite 
        direction. This can be "none" if the selection direction is unknown.
    </li>
    <li><h4>size</h4>The initial size of the control. This value is in pixels unless the value 
        of the type attribute is text or password, in which case, it is an integer number of 
        characters. Starting in HTML5, this attribute applies only when the type attribute is 
        set to text, search, tel, url, email, or password; otherwise it is ignored. In addition, 
        the size must be greater than zero. If you don't specify a size, a default value of 20 
        is used.
    </li>
    <li><h4>spellcheck <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        Setting the value of this attribute to true indicates that the element needs to 
        have its spelling and grammar checked. The value default indicates that the 
        element is to act according to a default behavior, possibly based on the parent 
        element's own spellcheck value. The value false indicates that the element should 
        not be checked.

    </li>
    <li><h4>src </h4>
        If the value of the type attribute is image, this attribute specifies a URI for the 
        location of an image to display on the graphical submit button; otherwise it is ignored.
    </li>
    <li><h4>step <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        Works with the min and max attributes to limit the increments at which a numeric 
        or date-time value can be set. It can be the string any or a positive floating 
        point number. If this attribute is not set to any, the control accepts only values 
        at multiples of the step value greater than the minimum.

    </li>
    <li><h4>tabindex <mark>global in HTML5</mark></h4>
        The position of the element in the tabbing navigation order for the current document.
    </li>
    <li><h4>usemap <mark>obsolete in HTML5</mark></h4>
        The name of a &lt;map&gt; element to be used as an image map.

    </li>
    <li><h4>value </h4>
        The initial value of the control. This attribute is optional except when the value 
        of the type attribute is radio or checkbox.
        Note that when reloading the page, Gecko and IE will ignore the value specified in the HTML 
        source, if the value was changed before the reload.
    </li>
    <li><h4>width  <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        If the value of the type attribute is image, this attribute defines the width of the
        image displayed for the button.
    </li>
    <li><h4>x-moz-errormessage</h4>    This Mozilla extension allows you to specify the error 
        message to display when a field doesn't successfully validate.



    </li>
