<p>
    The HTML &lt;caption&gt; Element (or HTML Table Caption Element) represents the title 
    of a table. Though it is always the first descendant of a &lt;table>, its styling, 
    using CSS, may place it elsewhere, relative to the table.
</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.

<h4>Usage note:</h4> 
<p>When the &lt;table> element that is the parent of this &lt;caption&gt; is the 
    only descendant of a &lt;figure&gt; element, use the &lt;figcaption&gt; element instead.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><h4>align <mark>Obsolete since HTML5</mark></h4>
        This enumerated attribute indicates how the caption must be aligned with 
        respect to the table. It may have the following values:

        left, displayed to the left of the table
        top, displayed before the the table
        right, displayed to the right of the table
        bottom, displayed under the table

    </li>

</ul>
<h4>Usage note:</h4>
Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated: the &lt;caption&gt; 
element should be styled using CSS. To give a similar effect to the align 
attribute, use the the CSS properties caption-side and text-align.
