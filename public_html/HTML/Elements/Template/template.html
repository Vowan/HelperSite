<p>
    The HTML template element &lt;template&gt; is a mechanism for holding client-side content 
    that is not to be rendered when a page is loaded but may subsequently be instantiated 
    during runtime using JavaScript. 
</p>
<p>
    Think of a template as a content fragment that is being stored for subsequent use in the
    document. While the parser does process the contents of the &lt;template&gt; element while 
    loading the page, it does so only to ensure that those contents are valid; the
    element's contents are not rendered, however.
