<p>
The HTML &lt;fieldset&gt; element is used to group several controls as well as labels 
    (&lt;label&gt;) within a web form.
</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>disabled <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        If this Boolean attribute is set, the form controls that are its descendants, 
        except descendants of its first optional &lt;legend&gt; element, are disabled, i.e., 
        not editable. They won't receive any browsing events, like mouse clicks or 
        focus-related ones. Often browsers display such controls as gray.
    </li>
    <li><h4>form <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        This attribute has the value of the id attribute of the &lt;form&gt; element its related to. 
            Its default value is the id of the nearest &lt;form&gt; element it is a descendant of.
    </li>
    <li><h4>name <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>
        The name associated with the group.<br>
The label for the field set is given by the first &lt;legend&gt; element that is a child of this 
field set.
    </li>
    
</ul>
