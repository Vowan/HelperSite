<p>
    The HTML &lt;menu&gt; element represents a group of commands that a user can perform or activate. 
    This includes both list menus, which might appear across the top of a screen, as well 
    as context menus, such as those that might appear underneath a button after it has been clicked.
    <strong>Usage note:</strong> The &lt;menu&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; elements both represent an unordered list 
    of items. 
    The key difference is that &lt;ul&gt; primarily contains items for display, whilst
    &lt;menu&gt; is intended for interactive items, to act on.

    <strong>Notes: </strong>This element was deprecated in HTML4, but reintroduced in HTML5.1 
    (still working draft).")}}. This document describes current Firefox implementation. 
    Type 'list' is likely to change to 'toolbar' and 'context' to 'popup' according to 
    HTML5.1 working draft.")}}

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>label</h4>
        The name of the menu as shown to the user. Used within nested menus, to 
        provide a label through which the submenu can be accessed. Must only be 
        specified when the parent element is a &lt;menu&gt; in the context menu state.
    </li>
    <li><h4>type</h4>
        This attribute indicates the kind of menu being declared, and can be one of two values.
        <ul>
            <li>context: The context menu state, which represents a group of commands activated through 
                another element. This might be through the menu attribute of a &lt;button&gt;, or an element 
                with a contextmenu attribute. When nesting &lt;menu&gt; elements directly within one another,
                this is the missing value default if the parent is already in this state.
            <li> list: The list menu state, which represents a series of commands for user interaction. This
                is the missing value default, except where the parent element is a &lt;menu&gt; in the context 
                menu state.
        </ul>
    </li>

</ul>
