<p>
    The border-radius CSS property allows Web authors to define how rounded border 
    corners are. The curve of each corner is defined using one or two radii, defining 
    its shape: circle or ellipse.
</p>

<p>
    The radius applies to the whole background, even if the element has no border; 
    the exact position of the clipping is defined by the background-clip property.
</p>
<p>
    This property is a shorthand to set the four properties border-top-left-radius, 
    border-top-right-radius, border-bottom-right-radius and border-bottom-left-radius.
