    The HTML Table Column Group Element (&lt;colgroup&gt;) defines a group of columns within a table.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>align <mark>Obsolete since HTML5</mark></h4>
        This enumerated attribute specifies how horizontal alignment of each column cell content will be handled. Possible values are:
        <ul>
            <li>left, aligning the content to the left of the cell
            <li> center, centering the content in the cell
            <li>right, aligning the content to the right of the cell
            <li>justify, inserting spaces into the textual content so that the content is 
                justified in the cell
            <li>char, aligning the textual content on a special character with a minimal 
                offset, defined by the char and charoff attributes Unimplemented (see bug 2212).
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h4>bgcolor</h4>This attribute defines the background color of each cell of the column. 
        It is one of the 6-digit hexadecimal code as defined in sRGB, prefixed by a '#'.
        One of the sixteen predefined color strings may be used: 
    </li>
    <li><h4>char  <mark>Obsolete since HTML5</mark></h4>This attribute specifies the alignment of the content in a column 
        group to a character. Typical values for this include a period (.) when attempting 
        to align numbers or monetary values. If align is not set to char, this attribute is 
        ignored, though it will still be used as the default value for the align of the &lt;col&gt;
        which are members of this column group. 
    </li>
    <li><h4>charoff <mark>Obsolete since HTML5</mark></h4>
        This attribute is used to indicate the number of characters to offset the 
        column data from the alignment characters specified by the char attribute. 
    </li>
    <li><h4>span</h4>
        This attribute contains a positive integer indicating the number of consecutive columns
        the &lt;colgroup&gt; element spans. 
        If not present, its default value is 1.
    </li>
    <li><h4>valign <mark>Obsolete since HTML5</mark></h4>
        This attribute specifies the vertical alignment of the text within each cell of the column. 
        Possible values for this attribute are:

        baseline, which will put the text as close to the bottom of the cell as it is possible, but align it on the baseline of the characters instead of the bottom of them. If characters are all of the size, this has the same effect as bottom.
        bottom, which will put the text as close to the bottom of the cell as it is possible;
        middle, which will center the text in the cell;
        and top, which will put the text as close to the top of the cell as it is possible.

    </li>
    <li><h4>width <mark>Obsolete since HTML5</mark></h4>
        This attribute specifies a default width for each column in the current column group. 
        In addition to the standard pixel and percentage values, this attribute might take 
        the special form 0*, which means that the width of each column in the group should 
        be the minimum width necessary to hold the column's contents. Relative widths such 
        as 0.5* also can be used.
    </li>
</ul>
