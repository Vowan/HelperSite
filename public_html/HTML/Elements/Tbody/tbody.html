<p>
The HTML Table Body Element (&lt;tbody&gt;) defines one or more &lt;tr&gt; element data-rows 
to be the body of its parent &lt;table&gt; element (as long as no &lt;tr&gt; elements are immediate 
children of that table element.)  In conjunction with a preceding &lt;thead&gt; and/or &lt;tfoot&gt;
element, &lt;tbody&gt; provides additional semantic information for devices such as printers 
and displays. Of the parent table's child elements, &lt;tbody&gt; represents the content which,
when longer than a page, will most likely differ for each page printed; while the content 
of &lt;thead&gt; and &lt;tfoot&gt; will be the same or similar for each page printed. For displays, 
&lt;tbody&gt; will enable separate scrolling of the &lt;thead&gt;, &lt;tfoot&gt;, and &lt;caption&gt; elements of 
the same parent &lt;table&gt; element.  Note that unlike the &lt;thead&gt;, &lt;tfoot&gt;, 
and &lt;caption&gt;
elements however, multiple &lt;tbody&gt; elements are permitted (if consecutive), allowing the 
data-rows in long tables to be divided into different sections, each separately formatted 
as needed.
