<p>
The @keyframes CSS at-rule lets authors control the intermediate steps in a CSS animation sequence by establishing keyframes (or waypoints) along the animation sequence that must be reached by certain points during the animation. This gives you more specific control over the intermediate steps of the animation sequence than you'd get when letting the browser handle everything automatically.

<p>
   To use keyframes, you create a @keyframes rule with a name that is then used by the animation-name property to match an animation to its keyframe list. Each @keyframes rule contains a style list of keyframe selectors, each of which is comprised of a percentage along the animation at which the keyframe occurs as well as a block containing the style information for that keyframe.
