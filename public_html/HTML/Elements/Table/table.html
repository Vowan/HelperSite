<p>
    The HTML Table Element (&lt;table&gt;) represents data in two dimensions or more.
</p>
<h4>Note:</h4> 
<p>
    Prior to the creation of CSS, HTML &lt;table&gt; elements were often used as a 
    method for page layout. This usage has been discouraged since HTML 4, and the 
<table> element should not be used for layout purposes. However, HTML emails 
    are an exception, where tables are still commonly used for layout purposes.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>align <mark>(deprecated)</mark></h4>
        This enumerated attribute indicates how the table must be aligned in regard of the
        containing document. It may have the following values:
        <ul>
            <li>left, meaning that the table is to be displayed to the left of the document;
            <li>center, meaning that the table is to be displayed centered in the document;
            <li>right, meaning that the table is to be displayed to the right of the document.
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><h4>bgcolor <mark>(deprecated)</mark></h4>
        This attribute defines the background color of the table and its content. It 
        is one of the 6-digit hexadecimal code as defined in sRGB, prefixed by a '#'.
        One of the sixteen predefined color strings may be used: 
    </li>
    <li><h4>border <mark>(deprecated)</mark></h4>
        This integer attribute defines, in pixels, the size of the frame surrounding the table. 
        If set to 0, it implies that the frame attribute is set to void.
        <p>
            <strong>Usage note:</strong> Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated and 
            the &lt;table&gt; 
            element should be styled using CSS. To give an effect similar to the border attribute, 
            the CSS properties border, border-color, border-width and border-style should be used.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>cellpadding <mark>(deprecated)</mark></h4>
        This attribute defines the space between the content of a cell and the border, 
        displayed or not, of it. If it is a pixel length, this pixel-sized space will be 
        applied on all four sides; if it is a percentage length, the content will be 
        centered and the total vertical space (top and bottom) will represent this 
        percentage. The same is true for the total horizontal space (left and right). 
        <p>
            <strong>Usage note:</strong> Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated 
            and the &lt;table&gt; element should be styled using CSS. To give an effect similar to 
            the cellpadding attribute, use the CSS property border-collapse with the value 
            collapse on the &lt;table&gt; element itself, and the property padding on the <td>.
        </p>
        </li>
    <li><h4>cellspacing <mark>(deprecated)</mark></h4>
        This attribute defines the size, in percentage or in pixels, of the space between 
        two cells (both horizontally and vertically), between the top of the table and the 
        cells of the first row, the left of the table and the first column, the right of 
        the table and the last column and the bottom of the table and the last row. 
        <p>
            <strong>Usage note:</strong> Do not use this attribute, as it has been 
            deprecated and the <table> element should be styled using CSS. To give an 
            effect similar to the cellspacing attribute, use the CSS property border-spacing 
            on the &lt;table&gt; element itself.
            </p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>frame <mark>(deprecated)</mark></h4>
        This enumerated attribute defines which side of the frame surrounding the 
        table must be displayed. It may have the following values:
        <p>
            <strong>Usage note:</strong> Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated 
            and the &lt;table&gt; element should be styled using CSS. To give an effect similar to 
            the frame attribute, use the CSS properties border-style and border-width.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><h4>rules <mark>(deprecated)</mark></h4>
        This enumerated attribute defines where rules, i.e. lines, should appear in a table. 
        It can have the following values:
        <ul>
    </li>none, which indicates the no rules will be displayed; it is the default value;
    </li>groups, which will make the rules to be displayed between row groups (defined by 
    the &lt;thead&gt;, &lt;tbody&gt; and &lt;tfoot&gt; elements) and between column groups (defined by the 
    &lt;col&gt; and &lt;colgroup&gt; elements) only;
    </li>rows, which will make the rules to be displayed between rows;
    </li>columns, which will make the rules to be displayed between columns;
    </li>all, which wil make the rules to be displayed between rows and columns.
    <p>
        <strong>Usage note:</strong> 
        The styling of the rules is browser-dependant and cannot be modified.
        Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated and the rules should be defined and styled 
        using CSS. Use the CSS property border on the adequate &lt;thead&gt;, &lt;tbody&gt;, 
        &lt;tfoot&gt;, 
        &lt;col&gt; or 
        &lt;colgroup&gt; elements.

    </p>
</ul>
</li>
<li><h4>summary <mark>(deprecated)</mark></h4>
    This attribute defines an alternative text use to describe the table in user-agent 
    unable to display it. Typically, it contents a description of it to allow visually 
    impaired people, like blind people browsing the web using Braille screen, to get 
    the information in it. If the information added in this attribute may also be useful 
    for non-visually impaired people, consider using the &lt;caption&gt; instead. The summary 
    attribute is not mandatory and may be omitted when a &lt;caption&gt; element fulfills its role. 
    <p>
        <strong>Usage note:</strong> Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated. 
        Instead, use one of these way of describing a table:
    <ul>
        <li> In prose, surrounding the table (this is the less semantic-conveying way of doing it).
        <li>In the table's &lt;caption&gt; element.
        <li>In a &lt;details&gt; element, inside the table's &lt;caption&gt; element.
        <li>Include the &lt;table&gt; element in a &lt;figure&gt; element and add the description in prose next 
            to it.
        <li>Include the &lt;table&gt; element in a &lt;figure&gt; element and add the description in prose 
            inside 
            a &lt;figcaption&gt; element.
        <li>Adjust the table so that such description is no more needed, by using &lt;th&gt; and
            &lt;thead&gt; e        lements for example.
    </ul>
    </p>

</li>
<li><h4>width <mark>(deprecated)</mark></h4>
    This attribute defines the width of the table. It may either be a pixel length or a 
    percentage value, representing the percentage of the width of its container that the 
    table should use. 
    <p>
        <strong>Usage note:</strong> Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated 
        and the rules should be defined and styled using CSS. Use the CSS property width 
        instead.
    </p>
</li>
</ul>
