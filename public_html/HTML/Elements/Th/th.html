        if its value is set to 0, it does extend until the end of the &lt;colgroup&gt;, 
        eventually implicitly defined, the cell belongs to. Values higher than 1000 
        are clipped down to 1000.

        corresponding to the id attribute of the &lt;th&gt; elements that applies to this element.

        indicates on how many rows does the cell extend. Its default value is 1; 
        if its value is set to 0, it does extend until the end of the table section 
        (&lt;thead&gt;, &lt;tbod&gt;, &lt;tfoot&gt;, eventually implicitly defined) the cell belongs

                that this element belongs to. The remaining cells are either those to the right of
