            typically the &lt;footer&gt; element often has a list of links that don't 
            need to be in a &lt;nav&gt; element.
    </li>
    <li><h4></h4>A document may have several &lt;nav&gt; elements, for example, one for
            site navigation and one for intra-page navigation.
    </li>
    <li><h4></h4>User agents, such as screen readers targeting disabled users, 
        can use this element to determine whether to omit the initial rendering of this content.
