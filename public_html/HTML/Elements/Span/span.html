<p>
The HTML &lt;span&gt; element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which 
    does not inherently represent anything. It can be used to group elements for 
    styling purposes (using the class or id attributes), or because they share 
    attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only when no other semantic 
    element is appropriate. &lt;span&gt; is very much like a &lt;div&gt; element, but &lt;div&gt; 
                is a block-level element whereas a &lt;span&gt;is an inline element.
