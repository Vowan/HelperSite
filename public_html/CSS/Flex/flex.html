<p>
    The flex CSS property is a shorthand property specifying the ability of a flex item to alter its dimensions to fill available space. Flex items can be stretched to use available space proportional to their flex grow factor or their flex shrink factor to prevent overflow.

<ul>
    <li><h4>flex-grow</h4>
    Defines the flex-grow of the flex item. See number for more details. Negative values are considered invalid. Defaults to 0 when omitted.
    </li>
    <li><h4>flex-shrink</h4>
Defines the flex-shrink of the flex item. See number for more details. Negative values are considered invalid. Defaults to 1 when omitted.
    </li>
    <li><h4>flex-basis</h4>
Defines the flex-basis of the flex item. Any value valid for width and height properties are accepted. A preferred size of 0 must have a unit to avoid being interpreted as a flexibility. Defaults to auto when omitted.
    </li>
    <li><h4>none</h4>
This keyword computes to 0 0 auto.
    </li>
    
</ul>
