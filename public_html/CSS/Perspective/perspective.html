<p>
The perspective CSS property determines the distance between the z=0 plane and the user in order to give to the 3D-positioned element some perspective. Each 3D element with z>0 becomes larger; each 3D-element with z<0 becomes smaller. The strength of the effect is determined by the value of this property
</p>
<p>
The vanishing point is by default placed at the center of the element, but its position can be changed using the perspective-origin property.

Is a length giving the distance from the user to the z=0 plane. It is used to apply a perspective transform to the element and its content. If it 0 or a negative value, no perspective transform is applied.
