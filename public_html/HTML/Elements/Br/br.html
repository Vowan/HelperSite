<p>
The HTML element line break &lt;br&gt; produces a line break in text (carriage-return). 
It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.<br>

Do not use &lt;br&gt; to increase the gap between lines of text; use the CSS margin 
property or the &lt;p&gt;element.
