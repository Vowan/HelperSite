<p>
The HTML &lt;article&gt; element represents a self-contained composition in a document,
    page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable
    or reusable (e.g., in syndication). This could be a forum post, a magazine or 
    newspaper article, a blog entry, an object, or any other independent item of 
    content. Each &lt;article&gt; should be identified, 
    typically by including a heading (&lt;&gt; element) as a child of 
            the &lt;article&gt; element.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<h4>Usage note:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><h4></h4>When an &lt;article&gt; element is nested, the inner element represents 
            an article related to the outer element. For example, the comments of a 
            blog post can be &lt;article&gt; elements nested in the &lt;article&gt;<article> representing 
            the blog post.
    </li>
    <li><h4></h4>Author information of an &lt;article&gt; element can be provided through 
            the &lt;article&gt; element, but it doesn't apply to nested &lt;article&gt; elements.
    </li>
    <li><h4></h4>The publication date and time of an &lt;article&gt; element can be described
            using the datetime attribute of a &lt;time&gt;<time> element. Note that the pubdate 
                attribute of &lt;time&gt;<time> is no longer a part of the W3C HTML 5 standard.
    </li>
    
</ul>
