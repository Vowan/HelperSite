<p>
The HTML Strikethrough Element (&lt;s&gt;) renders text with a strikethrough, or a line 
    through it. Use the &lt;s&gt; element to represent things that are no longer relevant 
        or no longer accurate. However, &lt;s&gt; is not appropriate when indicating 
            document edits; for that, use the &lt;del&gt; and &lt;ins&gt; elements, as appropriate.
