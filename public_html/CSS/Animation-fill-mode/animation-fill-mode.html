<p>
The animation-fill-mode property specifies a style for the element when the animation is not playing (when it is finished, or when it has a delay).
</p>
<p>
By default, CSS animations do not affect the element until the first keyframe is "played", and then stops once the last keyframe has completed. The animation-fill-mode property can override this behavior.

<ul>
    <li><h4>none</h4>
        Default value. The animation will not apply any styles to the target element before or after it is executing
    </li>
    <li><h4>forwards</h4>
        After the animation ends (determined by animation-iteration-count), the animation will apply the property values for the time the animation ended
    </li>
    <li><h4>backwards</h4>
        The animation will apply the property values defined in the keyframe that will start the first iteration of the animation, during the period defined by animation-delay. These are either the values of the from keyframe (when animation-direction is "normal" or "alternate") or those of the to keyframe (when animation-direction is "reverse" or "alternate-reverse")
    </li>
    <li><h4>both</h4>
        The animation will follow the rules for both forwards and backwards. That is, it will extend the animation properties in both directions 
    </li>
    
</ul>
