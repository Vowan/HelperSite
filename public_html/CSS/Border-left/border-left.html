    The border-left CSS property is a shorthand that sets the values of border-left-color, 
    border-left-style, and border-left-width. These properties describe the bottom border of 
    elements.

    them may be omitted.

    that it can set, even if they are not specified. It sets those that are not specified to their 
    default values. This means that:
