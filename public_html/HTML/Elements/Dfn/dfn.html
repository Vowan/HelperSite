<p>
    The HTML Definition Element (&lt;dfn&gt;) represents the defining instance of a term.
</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<h4>HTML5 Usage Notes:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><h4></h4>The <dfn> element marks the term being defined; the definition 
            of the term should be given by the surrounding &lt;p&gt;, &lt;section&gt; or 
            definition list group (usually a &lt;dt&gt;, &lt;dd&gt; pair).
    </li>
    <li><h4></h4>The exact value of the term being defined is determined by the following rules:
        <ol>
            <li>If the &lt;dfn&gt; element has a title attribute, then the term is the value 
                of that attribute.
            <li> Else, if it contains only an &lt;abbr&gt; element with a title attribute, then the 
                term is the value of that attribute.
            <li>Otherwise, the text content of the &lt;dfn&gt; element is the term being defined.
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    In HTML5, the title attribute has special meaning, as noted above.
