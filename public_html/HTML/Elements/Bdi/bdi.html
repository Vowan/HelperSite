<p>
The HTML &lt;bdi&gt; Element (or Bi-Directional Isolation Element) isolates a span of 
    text that might be formatted in a different direction from other text outside it.<br>

This element is useful when embedding text with an unknown directionality, from a 
database for example, inside text with a fixed directionality.
</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
Like all other HTML elements, this element has the global attributes, with a slight 
semantic difference: the dir attribute is not inherited. If not set, its default 
value is the auto which let the browser decide the direction based on the element's 
content.
<h4>Notes</h4>
<ul>
    <li><h4></h4>
        Though the same visual effect can be achieved using the CSS rule unicode-bidi: 
        isolate on a &lt;span&gt; or another text-formatting element, the semantic meaning 
        is only conveyed by the &lt;bdi&gt; element. Especially, browsers are allowed to 
        ignore CSS styling. In such a case, the text would still be correctly displayed 
        using the HTML element, but will become garbage when using the CSS styling to 
        convey semantic.
    </li>
    
</ul>
