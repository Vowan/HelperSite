<p>
The HTML &lt;footer&gt;<> element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content 
    or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains information about the 
    author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<h4>Usage note:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><h4></h4>Enclose information about the author in an &lt;address&gt;<> element that can be included 
        into the &lt;footer&gt;<> element.
    </li>
    <li><h4></h4>The &lt;footer&gt;<> element is not sectioning content and therefore doesn't introduce a
        new section in the outline.
    </li>
    
</ul>
&lt;&gt;
