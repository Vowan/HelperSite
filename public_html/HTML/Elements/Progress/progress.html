<p>
The HTML &lt;progress&gt; Element is used to view the completion progress of a task. 
    While the specifics of how it's displayed is left up to the browser developer, 
    it's typically displayed as a progress bar. Javascript can be used to manipulate 
    the value of progress bar.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>max</h4>This attribute describes how much work the task indicated by 
        the progress element requires. The max attribute, if present, must have a 
        value greater than zero and be a valid floating point number.
    </li>
    <li><h4>value</h4>
        This attribute specifies how much of the task that has been completed. 
        It must be a valid floating point number between 0 and max, or between 0 
        and 1 if max is omitted. If there is no value attribute, the progress bar 
        is indeterminate; this indicates that an activity is ongoing with no 
        indication of how long it is expected to take.
    </li>
    
</ul>
