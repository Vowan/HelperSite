<p>
The HTML &lt;canvas&gt; Element can be used to draw graphics via scripting (usually JavaScript). 
    For example, it can be used to draw graphs, make photo compositions or even perform animations. 
    You may (and should) provide alternate content inside the &lt;canvas&gt; block. That content 
        will be rendered both on older browsers that don't support canvas and in browsers with 
        JavaScript disabled.7
