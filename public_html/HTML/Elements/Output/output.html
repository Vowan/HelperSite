<p>
The HTML &lt;output&gt; element represents the result of a calculation or user action.
</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>for </h4>
        A list of IDs of other elements, indicating that those elements contributed 
        input values to (or otherwise affected) the calculation.
    </li>
    <li><h4>form</h4>
        The form element that this element is associated with (its "form owner"). 
        The value of the attribute must be an ID of a form element in the same document. 
        If this attribute is not specified, the output element must be a descendant of 
        a form element. This attribute enables you to place output elements anywhere 
        within a document, not just as descendants of their form elements.
    </li>
    <li><h4>name</h4>
        The name of the element.
    </li>
    
</ul>
