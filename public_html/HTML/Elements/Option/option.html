<p>
In a Web form, the HTML &lt;option&gt; element is used to create a control representing 
    an item within a &lt;select&gt; an &lt;optgroup&gt; or a &lt;datalist&gt; HTML5 element.
</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>disabled</h4>If this Boolean attribute is set, this option is not 
        checkable. Often browsers grey out such control and it won't receive any 
        browsing event, like mouse clicks or focus-related ones. If this attribute 
        is not set, the element can still be disabled if one its ancestors is a 
        disabled &lt;optgroup&gt; element.
    </li>
    <li><h4>label</h4>
        This attribute is text for the label indicating the meaning of the option. 
        If the label attribute isn't defined, its value is that of the element text content.
    <strong>Usage note: </strong>the label attribute is designed to contain a short 
    label typically used in a hierarchical menu. The value attribute describes a longer 
    label designed to be used near a radio button, for example.
    </li>
    <li><h4>selected</h4>If present, this Boolean attribute indicates that the 
        option is initially selected. If the &lt;option&gt; element is the descendant 
        of a &lt;select&gt; element whose multiple attribute is not set, only one single 
        &lt;option&gt; of this &lt;select&gt; element may have the selected attribute.
    </li>
    <li><h4>value</h4>The content of this attribute represents the value to be 
        submitted with the form, should this option be selected. If this attribute 
        is omitted, the value is taken from the text content of the option element.
    </li>
    
</ul>
