<p>
The HTML &lt;ol&gt; Element (or HTML Ordered List Element) represents an ordered list of 
    items. Typically, ordered-list items are displayed with a preceding numbering,
    which can be of any form, like numerals, letters or Romans numerals or even 
    simple bullets. This numbered style is not defined in the HTML description of 
    the page, but in its associated CSS, using the list-style-type property.<br>

There is no limitation to the depth and overlap of lists defined with the &lt;ol&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; elements.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>compact</h4>Note: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated: 
        the &lt;ol&gt; element should be styled using CSS. To give an effect similar to 
            the compact attribute, the CSS property line-height can be used with a value of 80%.
    </li>
    <li><h4>reversed <mark>HTML5</mark></h4>This Boolean attribute specifies that the items of the 
        item are specified in the reverse order, i.e. that the least important 
        one is listed first.
    </li>
    <li><h4>start<mark>HTML5</mark></h4>This integer attribute specifies the start value for numbering 
        the individual list items. Although the ordering type of list elements might 
        be Roman numerals, such as XXXI, or letters, the value of start is always 
        represented as a number. To start numbering elements from the letter "C", 
        use &lt;ol start="3"&gt;.
    </li>
    <li><h4>type</h4>
        Indicates the numbering type:<br>

    'a' indicates lowercase letters,<br>
    'A' indicates uppercase letters,<br>
    'i' indicates lowercase Roman numerals,<br>
    'I' indicates uppercase Roman numerals,<br>
    and '1' indicates numbers (default).<br>

The type set is used for the entire list unless a different type attribute is used 
within an enclosed &lt;li&gt; element.
        <p>Note: This attribute was deprecated in HTML4, but reintroduced in HTML5. 
            Unless the value of the list number matters (e.g. in legal or technical 
            documents where items are to be referenced by their number/letter), the 
            CSS list-style-type property should be used instead.</p>
    </li>
    
</ul>
