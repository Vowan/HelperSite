<p>
The HTML &lt;hr&gt; element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements 
(for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic with a section). 
In previous versions of HTML, it represented a horizontal rule. It may still be 
displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, but is now defined in semantic 
terms, rather than presentational terms.
