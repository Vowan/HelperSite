<p>
In a Web form, the HTML &lt;optgroup&gt; element  creates a grouping of options within a &lt;select&gt; 
element.
</p>
<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>disabled</h4>
        If this Boolean attribute is set, none of the items in this option group 
        is selectable. Often browsers grey out such control and it won't receive 
        any browsing events, like mouse clicks or focus-related ones.
    </li>
    <li><h4>label</h4>
        The name of the group of options, which the browser can use when labeling 
        the options in the user interface. This attribute is mandatory if this element is used.
    
</ul>
