<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<h4>Usage Note:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><h4></h4>Typically this element is displayed in italic type. However, it 
        should not be used simply to apply italic styling; use the CSS styling for 
        that purpose. Use the &lt;cite&gt; element to mark the title of a work (book, 
        play, song, etc.); it is also typically styled with italic type, but carries 
        different meaning. Use the &lt;strong&gt; element to mark text that has greater 
        importance than surrounding text.
    </li>
    
</ul>
