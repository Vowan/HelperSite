<p>
    The &lt;length&gt; CSS data type denotes distance measurements. It is a &lt;number&gt; immediately 
    followed by a length unit (px, em, pc, in, mm, …). Like for any CSS dimension, 
    there is no space between the unit literal and the number. The length unit is 
    optional after the &lt;number&gt; 0
</p>

<h4>Font-relative lengths</h4>
<ul>
    <li><h4>em</h4>
        This unit represents the calculated font-size of the element. If used on the 
        font-size property itself, it represents the inherited font-size of the element.<br>

        This unit is often used to create scalable layouts, which keep the vertical rhythm of 
        the page, even when the user changes the size of the fonts. The CSS properties 
        line-height, 
        font-size, margin-bottom and margin-top often has a value expressed in em.
    </li>
    <li><h4>ex</h4>
        This unit represents the x-height of the element's font. On fonts with the 'x' 
        letter, this is generally the height of lowercase letters in the font; 1ex ≈ 0.5em 
        in many fonts
    </li>
    <li><h4>ch</h4>
        This unit represents the width, or more precisely the advance measure, of the glyph '0' 
        (zero, the Unicode character U+0030) in the element's font.
    </li>
    <li><h4>rem</h4>
        This unit represents the font-size of the root element (e.g. the font-size of 
        the &lt;html&gt; element). When used on the font-size on this root element, it represents 
        its initial value.<br>
This unit is practical in creating perfectly scalable layout. If not supported by the 
targeted browsers, such layout can be achieved using the em unit, though this is slightly 
more complex.
    </li>

</ul>

<h4>Viewport-percentage lengths</h4>
<p>
    Viewport-percentage lengths defined a length relatively to the size of viewport, that 
    is the visible portion of the document. Only Gecko-based browsers are updating the viewport 
    values dynamically, when the size of the viewport is modified (by modifying the size of 
    the window on a desktop computer or by turning the device on a phone or a tablet).
</p>
<ul>
    <li><h4>vh</h4>
        1/100th of the height of the viewport.
    </li>
    <li><h4>vw</h4>
        1/100th of the width of the viewport.
    </li>
    <li><h4>vmin</h4>
        1/100th of the minimum value between the height and the width of the viewport.
    </li>
    <li><h4>vmax</h4>
        1/100th of the maximum value between the height and the width of the viewport.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Absolute length units</h4>
<p>For low-dpi devices, the unit px represents the physical reference pixel and the 
    others are defined relative to it. Thus, 1in is defined as 96px which equals 72pt. 
    The consequence of this definition is that on such devices, length described in inches (in), 
    centimeters (cm), millimeters (mm) doesn't necessary match the length of the physical unit
    with the same name.
    
</p>
<p>
    For high-dpi devices, inches (in), centimeters (cm), millimeters (mm) are defined as 
    their physical counterparts. Therefore the px unit is defined relative to them (1/96 of 1 inch).
</p>
<ul>
    <li><h4>px</h4>
        Relative to the viewing device.
For screen display, typically one device pixel (dot) of the display.
For printers and very high resolution screens one CSS pixel implies multiple device pixels, 
so that the number of pixel per inch stays around 96.
    </li>
    <li><h4>mm</h4>
        One millimeter.
    </li>
    <li><h4>cm</h4>
        One centimeter (10 millimeters).
    </li>
    <li><h4>in</h4>
        One inch (2.54 centimeters).
    </li>
    <li><h4>pt</h4>
        One point (which is 1/72 of an inch).
    </li>
    <li><h4>pc</h4>
        One pica (which is 12 points).
    </li>
    <li><h4>mozmm</h4>
        An experimental unit which attempts to render at exactly one millimeter 
        regardless of the size or resolution of the display. This is rarely actually 
        what you want, but may be useful in particular for mobile devices.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4> Some specific examples: </h4>
<ul>
    <li>
       1in is always 96px, 
    </li>
    <li>
        3pt is always 4px,
    </li>
    <li>
        25.4mm is always 96px.
    </li>
</ul>
