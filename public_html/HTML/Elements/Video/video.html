<p>
    Use the  HTML &lt;video&gt; element to embed video content in a document. The video 
    element contains one or more video sources. To specify a video source, use either 
    the src attribute or the &lt;source&gt; element; the browser will choose the most suitable one.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.
<ul>
    <li><h4>autoplay</h4>
        A Boolean attribute; if specified, the video automatically begins to play back as soon
        as it can do so without stopping to finish loading the data.
    </li>
    <li><h4>autobuffer <mark>obsolete</mark></h4>
        A Boolean attribute; if specified, the video will automatically begin buffering even 
        if it's not set to play automatically. Use this attribute only when it is very likely
        that the user will watch the video. The video is buffered until the media cache is full. 
    </li>
    <li><h4>buffered</h4>An attribute you can read to determine the time ranges of the buffered 
        media. This attribute contains a TimeRanges object.
    </li>
    <li><h4>controls</h4>
        If this attribute is present, the browser will offer controls to allow the user to 
        control video playback, including volume, seeking, and pause/resume playback.
    </li>
    <li><h4>crossorigin</h4>This enumerated attribute indicates whether to use CORS to 
        fetch the related image. CORS-enabled resources can be reused in the &lt;canvas&gt; 
        element without being tainted. The allowed values are:
        <ul>
            <li><h4>anonymous</h4>
                Sends a  cross-origin request without a credential. In other words, it sends 
                the Origin: HTTP header without a cookie, X.509 certificate, or performing HTTP
                Basic authentication. If the server does not give credentials to the origin site
                (by not setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: HTTP header), the image will be
                tainted, and its usage restricted.
            </li>
            <li><h4>use-credentials</h4>
                Sends a  cross-origin request with a credential. In other words, it sends the 
                Origin: HTTP header with a cookie, a certificate, or performing HTTP Basic 
                authentication. If the server does not give credentials to the origin site 
                (through Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: HTTP header), the image will be 
                tainted and its usage restricted.
            </li>
        </ul>
        When not present, the resource is fetched without a CORS request 
        (i.e. without sending the Origin: HTTP header), preventing its non-tainted used 
        in &lt;canvas&gt; elements. If invalid, it is handled as if the enumerated keyword 
        anonymous was used. See CORS settings attributes for additional information.

    </li>
    <li><h4>height</h4>
        The height of the video's display area, in CSS pixels.
    </li>
    <li><h4>loop</h4>
        A Boolean attribute; if specified, we will, upon reaching the end of the video, 
        automatically seek back to the start.
    </li>
    <li><h4>muted</h4>
        A Boolean attribute which indicates the default setting of the audio contained 
        in the video. If set, the audio will be initially silenced. Its default value is 
        false, meaning that the audio will be played when the video is played.
    </li>
    <li><h4>played</h4>
        A TimeRanges object indicating all the ranges of the video that have been played.
    </li>
    <li><h4>preload</h4>This enumerated attribute is intended to provide a hint to the browser about what the author thinks will lead to the best user experience. It may have one of the following values:
        <ul>
            <li>none: indicates that the video should not be preloaded.
            <li> metadata: indicates that only video metadata (e.g. length) is fetched.
            <li>auto: indicates that the whole video file could be downloaded, even if the user is not expected to use it.
                the empty 
            <li>string: synonym of the auto value.
        </ul>
        If not set, its default value is browser-defined (i.e. each browser may have its default value). The spec advises it to be set to metadata.
        <h4>Usage notes:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The autoplay attribute has precedence over preload. If autoplay is specified,
                the browser would obviously need to start downloading the video for playback.</li>
            <li>The specification does not force the browser to follow the value of this 
                attribute; it is a mere hint.</li>
        </ul>

    </li>
    <li><h4>poster</h4>A URL indicating a poster frame to show until the user plays or seeks. If this attribute isn't specified, nothing is displayed until the first frame is available; then the first frame is shown as the poster frame.
    </li>
    <li><h4>src</h4>
        The URL of the video to embed. This is optional; you may instead use the 
        &lt;source&gt; element within the video block to specify the video to embed.
    </li>
    <li><h4>width</h4>
        The width of the video's display area, in CSS pixels.
    </li>
</ul>
