<p>
The HTML Superscript Element (&lt;sup&gt;) defines a span of text that should be displayed,
    for typographic reasons, higher, and often smaller, than the main span of text.

<h3>Attributes</h3>
This element includes the global attributes.

<h4>Usage note:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><h4></h4>This element should be used for typographical reasons only, i.e. 
        changing the position of the text changing its meaning like in mathematical 
        (like f4, though the use of a MathML formula should be considered) or in French
        abbreviations (like Mlle, Mme or Cie).
    </li>
    <li><h4></h4>This element must not be used for styling purpose like the styling 
        of the product name Latex. In that case CSS style should be used: the vertical-align 
        property with the super value will achieve the same effect.
    </li>
    
</ul>
